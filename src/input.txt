The distribution layer, which is sometimes referred to as the aggregation layer, provides route filtering and interVLAN routing. Management ACLs and IPS filtering are typically implemented at the distribution layer. The distribution layer serves as an aggregation point for access layer network links. Because the distribution layer is the intermediary between the access layer and the core layer, the distribution layer is the ideal place to enforce security policies and to perform tasks that involve packet manipulation, such as routing. Summarization and next-hop redundancy are also performed in the distribution layer.
